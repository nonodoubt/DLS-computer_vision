## 1. Multiclass Classification of The Simpsons Characters
This project focuses on multiclass classification of characters from the animated series "The Simpsons". It uses a pretrained ResNet model with fine-tuning to classify images of different characters from the show. The dataset consists of labeled images of various Simpsons characters, and the model leverages transfer learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in identifying them <button class="citation-flag" data-index="5">.

## 2. Dog and Cat Classification
Implemented using PyTorch Lightning with a custom-built convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is trained to distinguish between images of dogs and cats, achieving high accuracy through the use of transfer learning techniques and data augmentation <button class="citation-flag" data-index="2">.

## 3. Square Detection
This project focuses on detecting the number of squares present in each image. The task involves developing an algorithm capable of identifying and counting all square shapes within various images. This can be approached using computer vision techniques such as edge detection, contour analysis, or machine learning models specifically trained for shape recognition <button class="citation-flag" data-index="7">.
